# Upgrading to Waypoint 0.11.0 from 0.10.x

Waypoint 0.10.x can be upgraded to Waypoint 0.11.0 using a [standard upgrade](/waypoint/docs/upgrading#standard-upgrade).
There are some considerations depending on what platform your server is installed on.
There are no breaking changes in the protocol or `waypoint.hcl` configuration file.
Due to the changes in `runner` management, we cannot guarantee that all Waypoint
components (CLI, entrypoint, and server) are forwards and backwards
compatible. We encourage users to have all components on the same version.

### ECS

### Kubernetes

### Nomad

#### Verifying the Server Version with the UI

You can verify the server version by loading the UI and looking at the footer.
You should see a version starting with `v0.11.0`. If you see an earlier version,
your platform may be using an old cached image.

#### Verifying the Server Version with the CLI

You can verify both the CLI version and server version by running:

```shell-session
$ waypoint version
CLI: v0.11.0 (-------)
Server: v0.11.0
```
