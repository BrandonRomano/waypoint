# Upgrading to Waypoint 0.11.0 from 0.10.x

Waypoint 0.10.x can be upgraded to Waypoint 0.11.0 using a [standard upgrade](/waypoint/docs/upgrading#standard-upgrade).
There are some considerations depending on what platform your server is installed on.
There are no breaking changes in the protocol or `waypoint.hcl` configuration file.
Due to the changes in `runner` management, we cannot guarantee that all Waypoint
components (CLI, entrypoint, and server) are forwards and backwards
compatible. We encourage users to have all components on the same version.

## Server Snapshot

### Docker

### AWS ECS

The database of a Waypoint server installed to AWS ECS is persisted in a file
system, provided by the Elastic File System (EFS) service of AWS. To preserve
the database during the upgrade, a new EFS volume will need to be created. An
access point will need to be added to this volume as well. This access point's
path must be set to `/waypointserverdata`. The POSIX user and root directory
creation permissions should both have their user and group ID set to `100` and
`1000`, respectively. The access point permissions should be set to `755`.

The data in the old file system must be synchronized to the new one. This may be
done using [AWS DataSync](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/what-is-datasync.html).
The source location should be configured as your old file system for the
Waypoint server and the destination should be configured as the file system you
just created.

Now that there are two file systems in EFS with the in your Waypoint database,
the next step is to upgrade the Waypoint server container to v0.11.0. To do
this, the task definition `waypoint-server` in ECS needs a new revision. The
only setting that must be changed is the image URI, which should be set to
`hashicorp/waypoint:0.11.0`. After the new revision of the task definition is
created, the `waypoint-server` service in ECS must be updated to use the
revision you just created.

If it is necessary to restore the snapshot to Waypoint, then a new revision of
the ECS task definition `waypoint-server` needs to be created. In this new
version, the storage configuration must be updated to replace the existing file
system with the one created as part of this snapshot process. With that updated,
the `waypoint-server` ECS service needs to be updated once more to use the
newest revision of the `waypoint-server` task definition. At this point, the
server should be using the pre-upgrade snapshot of the database.

#### Verifying the Server Version with the UI

You can verify the server version by loading the UI and looking at the footer.
You should see a version starting with `v0.11.0`. If you see an earlier version,
your platform may be using an old cached image.

#### Verifying the Server Version with the CLI

You can verify both the CLI version and server version by running:

```shell-session
$ waypoint version
CLI: v0.11.0 (-------)
Server: v0.11.0
```
