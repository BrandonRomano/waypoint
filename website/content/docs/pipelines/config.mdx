# Pipelines Configuration

This section details some of the various step built-in plugins and their
configuration options.

## Built-In Step Config Options

Currently, Pipeline steps have "built-in" plugins that are backed by the existing
Waypoint job system. Below documents each of these built-in steps and their
parameters.

### `build`

This built-in step will run a Build operation job, similar to running `waypoint build`.

```hcl
step "my-build-step" {
  use "build" {
    disable_push = false
  }
}
```

##### disable_push

- Type: **bool**
- **Optional**

### `deploy`

This built-in step will run a Deploy operation job, similar to running `waypoint deploy`.

```hcl
step "my-deploy-step" {
  use "deploy" {
  }
}
```

### `release`

This built-in step will run a Release operation job, similar to running `waypoint release`.

```hcl
step "my-release-step" {
  use "release" {
    prune        = true
    prune_retain = 4
  }
}
```

##### deployment_ref

0 or unset means do a release with the latest deployment. Otherwise this accepts
a Deployment sequence to release.

- Type: **int**
- **Optional**

##### prune

If true, will prune old releases beyond the `prune_retain` limit when a new release is created.

- Type: **bool**
- **Optional**

##### prune_retain

The total number of deployments to retain when pruning on a release. This will
only be valid if `prune_retain_override` is set to true.

- Type: **int**
- **Optional**
- Default: 2

##### prune_retain_override

If true, will respect the `prune_retain` value when pruning during a release.

- Type: **bool**
- **Optional**

### `up`

This built-in step will run an Up operation job, similar to running `waypoint up`.

```hcl
step "my-up-step" {
  use "up" {
    prune = true
  }
}
```

##### prune

If true, will prune old releases beyond the `prune_retain` limit when a new release is created.

- Type: **bool**
- **Optional**

##### prune_retain

The total number of deployments to retain when pruning on a release. This will
only be valid if `prune_retain_override` is set to true.

- Type: **int**
- **Optional**
- Default: 2

##### prune_retain_override

If true, will respect the `prune_retain` value when pruning during a release.

- Type: **bool**
- **Optional**

### `exec`

```hcl
step "my-exec-step" {
  use "exec" {
    command = "echo"
    args    = ["hello world!"]
  }
}
```

##### command

The command to execute on the container for this Step.

- Type: **string**
- **Required**

##### args

The arguments to pass through to the command when running on the container for this Step.

- Type: **string**
- **Optional**

### `pipeline`

This built-in step lets you reference another pipeline within a Step to be run.

```hcl
step "my-pipeline-step" {
  use "pipeline" {
    project = "my-pipeline-project"
    name    = "other-pipeline"
  }
}
```

##### project

The project that the pipeline reference exists in. **Note that currently
Waypoint does not support running across Project pipelines**.

- Type: **string**
- **Optional**

##### name

The pipeline name that the pipeline reference is for.

- Type: **string**
- **Required**
