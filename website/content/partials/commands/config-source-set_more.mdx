#### Additional Information

This command overrides all configuration already set for a configuration source plugin.
When modifying an existing configuration, all desired `-config` flags will need to be set each time the command is ran.

Since configuration for config source plugins is global the `-app`, `-project`, and `-workspace` flags are ignored on this command.
